GETTING CONNECTED
During the pandemic, 30.9% of adults felt their well-being had been affected by feelings of loneliness (UK GOV, 2020).
Majority of this was as a direct result of people being forced into working remotely, separated from family and friends and
ultimately disconnecting us from a normal and healthy social environment.
With this in mind, we want you to work as a team to build a site or app which
could help people Get Connected again
.
Some ideas may include (but not limited to) the following:
1.
Build a social networking site for your family & friends to stay connected
2.
Build a co-operative online game to compete with your friends & family

They is a part also were one can share their story during and after lock down on how their experienced it how they managed to forget about the loneliness and recover after lockdown. People can comment on the My story part.
