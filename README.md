# Project overview
ReConnect is a website supporting people to connect with others

Positive social connections are important for our physical and mental wellbeing. They can provide emotional support, practical assistance, information and a sense of belonging.

Some people experience difficulties in connecting with other people, particularly when experiencing mental health problems or if they are excluded from the normal activities of society.

## Site features

The site features full registration, log-in and log-out functionality with authentication built into both the front and back end to facilitate this.
