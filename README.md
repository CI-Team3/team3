# Project overview
ReConnect is a website supporting people to connect with others

Positive social connections are important for our physical and mental wellbeing. They can provide emotional support, practical assistance, information and a sense of belonging.

# UX Design
  ## Strategy and Scope
    - We want to offer an online supportive group through a social media application for psychological effects of pandemic.
    ### Target Audience
      - Some people experience difficulties in connecting with other people, particularly when experiencing mental health problems or if they are excluded from the normal activities of society.
  ## The Structure Plane
    - The title of this project is "ReConnect" and as it's suggesting is about RE - CONNECTing people by sharing with each other our experiences through and after the pandemic.
    - At the top of the page there is a navigation menu-bar, which provides link for each section of the website.
    - Some areas are accesible only to logged-in users. You need to be logged-in to be able to access live Chat functions, Account details, My Story section.
  ## Skeleton Plane
    - Develop Page Structure & Organize Interactions
  ## Surface Plane
    - Design Graphic User Interface







# UI Design
## Site features

The site features full registration, log-in and log-out functionality with authentication built into both the front and back end to facilitate this.



# Deployment
HEROKU (needs proper description)

1. Install the Heroku CLI if not yet installed
Further information about installation and setup can get here

2. Perform login with the heroku login command
You will be prompted with your default browser window for completing the login at the Heroku portal.

3. Assuming you already have your app set up at Heroku (if not, please follow this), you just need to add a new remote for your git repo with Heroku CLI.
Run heroku git:remote -a example-app - substitute "example-app" with your app name.

4. git remote -v to check if the remote has been set successfully
You should see something like this appear as a response

heroku  https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git (fetch)
heroku  https://git.heroku.com/your-app-name.git (push)
5. Push your branch to the new heroku remote
git push heroku your_branch_name

6. You should see the progress of your deployment being displayed in the terminal


heroku git:remote -a earthlings-hackathon
